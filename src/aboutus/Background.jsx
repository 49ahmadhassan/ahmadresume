      <p>With an honours degree in Psychology, I left University and relocated to Manchester to seek further opportunities from my upbringing in North Wales. While living up in the north, I worked in telecommunications sales and progressed to be a sales manager for NTL Business (now VirginMedia Business) within 3 years. During that time, I spent any spare time teaching myself and learning web design, which was a hobby back then.</p>
        <p>Following a redundacy from my sales role, I took the opportunity to change career path completely from corporate sales and joined a local company as their in-house web designer, taking a pay-cut and step backwards in career-progression.</p>
        <p>Four years later, I was Creative Director at a digital agency, leading design and development projects for Toyota, Tyco and Milliken.</p>
        <p>9 years on, I'm now freelancing as a WordPress specialist and have an array of clients ranging from bloggers, local businesses, corporate entities and more. I love the variation of my workload and every day is completely different.</p>
        <p>A lot of my work also involves completing work for agencies up and down the country, such graphic designers, web and digital agencies - on a white label basis - when they need an extra hands on deck.</p>
